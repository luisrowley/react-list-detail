# Introduction

Simple data table showcasing master-detail view pattern in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using the [Material Design](https://mui.com/) UI component Library and a [Context Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) pattern for data reusability in a global scope. Bare minimal project architecture was added as a means to achieving modularity.

# Installation:

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
